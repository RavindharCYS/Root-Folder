    *   `react-intersection-observer`: Efficiently triggers animations or actions when elements enter the viewport.
    *   `@lottiefiles/react-lottie-player`: For embedding high-quality, lightweight Lottie animations (e.g., on the 404 page).
    *   `lucide-react`: For clean and consistent SVG icons.

### 4.2. Backend
*   **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment, allowing for full-stack JavaScript development.
    *   *Rationale:* Non-blocking I/O makes it efficient for API development; large ecosystem of packages via npm.
*   **Express.js 4.x:** Minimalist and flexible Node.js web application framework.
    *   *Rationale:* Widely adopted, simplifies routing, middleware integration, and API creation.
*   **Mongoose:** MongoDB Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for Node.js.
    *   *Rationale:* Provides schema validation, type casting, query building, and business logic hooks for MongoDB.
*   **`express-validator`:** Middleware for server-side validation of request data.
    *   *Rationale:* Essential for data integrity and security, preventing invalid data from reaching controllers or the database.
*   **`multer`:** Middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, primarily used for file uploads (resumes).
    *   *Rationale:* Standard solution for managing file uploads in Express applications.
*   **`nodemailer`:** Module for sending emails from Node.js applications.
    *   *Rationale:* Flexible and widely used for sending transactional emails and notifications.

*   **PM2 (Conceptual for VPS):** Process manager for Node.js applications in production.

## 5. System Architecture

### 5.1. Frontend Architecture
*   **Single Page Application (SPA):** Built using React and React Router DOM. The client-side handles routing and UI updates, providing a fluid user experience.
*   **Component-Based Structure:** The UI is broken down into reusable components located in `src/components/`. Pages are assembled from these components.
*   **State Management:** Primarily uses React's built-in state management (`useState`, `useReducer` via custom hooks like `useConversation`) and context for global states if necessary (though not explicitly detailed for complex global state in the current scope).
*   **API Interaction:** Uses `fetch` API (or could use `axios`) to communicate with the backend RESTful API endpoints for dynamic data and form submissions. API base URL is configured via `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.
*   **Static Assets:** Images, Lottie files, and other static assets are served from the `public/` directory or bundled by Vite.

### 5.2. Backend Architecture
*   **RESTful API:** Exposes API endpoints for CRUD-like operations (Create for bookings, contacts, applications, subscriptions).
*   **MVC-like Pattern (Conceptual):**
    *   **Routes (`routes/`):** Define API endpoints and link them to validation middleware and controller functions.
    *   **Controllers (`controllers/`):** Handle incoming requests, process business logic, interact with models, and send responses.
    *   **Models (`models/`):** Define Mongoose schemas and interact with the MongoDB database.
    *   **Middleware (`middleware/`):** Handles tasks like file uploads (`multer`) and request validation (`express-validator`).
*   **Service Layer (`utils/`):** Contains utility functions like `emailSender.js`.
*   **Error Handling:** Basic global error handler in `server.js`.

### 5.3. Data Flow Examples
*   **Contact Form Submission:**
    1.  User fills form in `ContactPage.jsx` (React).
    2.  Client-side validation occurs.
    3.  On submit, `fetch` request sent to `POST /api/contact` with form data.
    4.  Backend `contactRoutes.js` receives request.
    5.  `express-validator` middleware validates data.
    6.  `contactController.js` processes validated data.
    7.  Data saved to MongoDB via `Contact` model.
    8.  `nodemailer` sends notification email to admin and confirmation to user.
    9.  Success/error response sent back to frontend.
    10. Frontend updates UI to show success/error message.
*   **Chatbot Interaction:**
    1.  User types message in `ChatWindow.jsx`.
    2.  `sendMessage` in `useConversation.js` is called.
    3.  User message added to local state and `localStorage`.
    4.  `getBotResponse` logic determines bot's reply based on keywords/context.
    5.  Bot response added to local state and `localStorage`.
    6.  UI re-renders to display new messages.

## 7. User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX) Design

### 7.1. Design Philosophy
*   **Modern & Professional:** Clean lines, contemporary fonts (`Inter`, `Plus Jakarta Sans`), and a professional color palette (Primary Blue, Dark Grays, Accent Teal/Purple/Orange/Yellow).
*   **User-Centric:** Focus on clear navigation, intuitive interactions, and readability.
*   **Engaging:** Use of animations, micro-interactions, and visually appealing sections to maintain user interest.
*   **Brand Consistent:** Logo, colors, and tone of voice are used consistently throughout the site.

### 7.2. Responsiveness
*   Tailwind CSS utility classes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`) are used extensively to ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes.
*   Flexbox and Grid are primary layout tools.
*   Images and interactive elements are tested for proper display and functionality on mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
*   Mobile navigation is a full-screen overlay for optimal usability.
*   Chatbot UI adapts significantly for mobile (bottom-sheet style).

### 7.3. Accessibility Considerations (Initial)
*   Semantic HTML5 elements used where appropriate (`<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`).
*   ARIA attributes (`aria-label`, `aria-expanded`) added to interactive elements like menu toggles and buttons.
*   Sufficient color contrast considered for text and background (requires further audit).
*   Keyboard navigation basics are generally supported by browser defaults and interactive elements.
*   Alternative text for images.
*   **Further Action:** A comprehensive accessibility audit (WCAG AA compliance) is recommended.

## 8. Backend API Design & Endpoints

### 8.1. API Design Principles
*   **RESTful:** Follows REST principles for endpoint design where applicable.
*   **Stateless:** Each API request contains all information needed for the server to process it.
*   **JSON for Data Exchange:** Uses JSON for request and response bodies.
*   **Clear Endpoint Naming:** e.g., `/api/bookings`, `/api/contact`.

### 8.2. Endpoint Details
*   **`POST /api/bookings`**: See Section 6.3.
*   **`POST /api/contact`**: See Section 6.3.
*   **`POST /api/careers`**: See Section 6.3. Handles `multipart/form-data` for resume.
*   **`POST /api/newsletter/subscribe`**: See Section 6.3.
*   **`GET /api/test`**: Simple health check endpoint.

### 8.3. Data Validation & Sanitization
*   `express-validator` is used for all incoming data on POST requests.
*   Checks include `notEmpty`, `isEmail`, `isLength`, `isURL`, `isMobilePhone`.
*   Sanitizers like `trim`, `normalizeEmail` are used.
*   Custom validation logic can be added within controllers if needed.

### 8.4. File Upload Handling (Careers)
*   `multer` middleware (`src/server/middleware/uploadMiddleware.js`) processes `resumeFile`.
*   **Storage:** Saves files to `server/uploads/resumes/` with unique filenames.
*   **File Type Filter:** Accepts PDF, DOC, DOCX.
*   **Size Limit:** 5MB.
*   The file path is stored in the `CareerApplications` MongoDB collection.

### 8.5. Email Notification System
*   `nodemailer` utility (`src/server/utils/emailSender.js`).
*   Configured via environment variables (`EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_PORT`, `EMAIL_USER`, `EMAIL_PASS`, etc.).
*   Sends HTML and plain text emails for:
    *   Booking confirmations (to user and admin).
    *   Contact form alerts (to admin and user auto-reply).
    *   Career application alerts (to admin and user confirmation).
    *   Newsletter welcome emails (optional).

## 9. Database Design

### 9.1. MongoDB Schema Overview
Mongoose schemas define the structure and validation for data stored in MongoDB. Each schema corresponds to a collection. Timestamps (`createdAt`, `updatedAt`) are automatically added.

### 9.2. Collections
*   **`bookings` (`src/server/models/Booking.js`):**
    *   Fields: `service`, `serviceLabel`, `date`, `time`, `name`, `email`, `company`, `website`, `submissionDate`.
*   **`contacts` (`src/server/models/Contact.js`):**
    *   Fields: `name`, `email`, `phone`, `subject`, `message`, `service`, `submissionDate`.
*   **`careerapplications` (`src/server/models/CareerApplication.js`):**
    *   Fields: `name`, `email`, `phone`, `position`, `experience`, `message`, `resumePath`, `submissionDate`.
*   **`newslettersubscriptions` (`src/server/models/NewsletterSubscription.js`):**
    *   Fields: `email` (unique), `subscriptionDate`.

## 10. Code Structure & Conventions
*(Refer to Section 4 in MANUAL.md for a visual directory tree)*

### 10.1. Frontend Directory Structure (`src/`)
*   **`assets/`**: Global CSS, fonts (if not CDN), any non-public static assets.
*   **`components/`**:
    *   `chatbot/`: Chatbot specific components (`TzurBot.jsx`, `ChatWindow.jsx`, `useConversation.js`).
    *   `layout/`: Structural components like `Header.jsx`, `Footer.jsx`.
    *   `sections/`: Larger, page-specific content blocks (e.g., `Hero.jsx`, `Services.jsx` for homepage).
    *   `ui/`: Generic, reusable UI elements (`Button.jsx`, `Preloader.jsx`, `CookieConsent.jsx`, etc.).
*   **`pages/`**: Top-level components representing distinct site pages/routes.
*   `App.jsx`: Main application component, router setup.
*   `main.jsx`: Application entry point.

### 10.2. Backend Directory Structure (`server/`)
*   **`config/`**: Configuration files (e.g., `db.js`).
*   **`controllers/`**: Logic for handling requests for each route.
*   **`middleware/`**: Custom Express middleware (e.g., `uploadMiddleware.js`).
*   **`models/`**: Mongoose schema definitions.
*   **`routes/`**: Express router definitions for API endpoints.

## 12. Build & Deployment Process

*(Refer to MANUAL.md for more detailed steps)*

### 12.1. Frontend Build Process
1.  Set production `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in `.env` (or `.env.production`).
2.  Run `npm run build` from the project root.
3.  Output is generated in the `dist/` folder.
4.  Contents of `dist/` are deployed to a static web host or the public directory of a web server.

### 12.2. Backend Deployment Strategy
1.  Upload backend source code (excluding `node_modules`, `.env`) to the server.
2.  Install production dependencies on server: `npm install --production`.
3.  Create and populate the production `.env` file on the server with correct credentials and URLs.
4.  Start the Node.js application using a process manager like PM2 or the hosting provider's mechanism (e.g., Hostinger's "Setup Node.js App").

### 12.3. Server Configuration Notes (SPA, CORS)
*   **SPA Fallback:** The web server serving the frontend must be configured to serve `index.html` for all non-asset routes to allow React Router to handle client-side routing (e.g., using `.htaccess` for Apache).
*   **CORS:** The backend `server.js` must have `cors` middleware configured with `allowedOrigins` including the production frontend domain.

## 13. Security Considerations

### 13.1. Frontend Security
*   **Input Validation:** Basic client-side validation on forms helps UX but is not a substitute for server-side validation.
*   **HTTPS:** Ensure the production site is served over HTTPS.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** React inherently helps prevent XSS by escaping data rendered in JSX. Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without proper sanitization.
*   **Dependency Management:** Keep npm packages updated to patch vulnerabilities.

### 13.2. Backend Security
*   **Server-Side Validation:** `express-validator` is used for all API inputs.
*   **Input Sanitization:** Implicitly handled by some `express-validator` methods (e.g., `normalizeEmail`). Further sanitization can be added if handling raw HTML or complex inputs.
*   **Rate Limiting:** (Future Enhancement) Implement rate limiting on APIs to prevent abuse (e.g., using `express-rate-limit`).
*   **Helmet.js:** (Future Enhancement) Use Helmet middleware for setting various HTTP headers to improve security.
*   **Environment Variables:** Sensitive data (API keys, DB URIs, email passwords) stored in `.env` files, not in code. Ensure `.env` is not committed to version control.
*   **Error Handling:** Avoid leaking sensitive error details in production responses.

### 13.3. Data Security & Privacy
*   **MongoDB Security:** Secure MongoDB instance with strong authentication, network access controls.
*   **Data in Transit:** Use HTTPS for all communication between frontend, backend, and database.
*   **Data at Rest:** Consider encryption for sensitive data in the database if required by regulations (beyond scope of current implementation).
*   **Privacy Policy:** Implemented and linked, outlines data handling practices. **Requires legal review.**
*   **Consent:** Cookie consent banner and consent checkboxes on forms implemented.

### 13.4. File Upload Security (Careers)
*   **`multer` Configuration:** Limits file size (5MB) and types (PDF, DOC, DOCX).
*   **Storage Location:** Files stored in `server/uploads/resumes/`. Access to this directory on the server should be restricted.
*   **Serving Files:** Currently, files can be served statically if the path is known. For enhanced security:
    *   (Future Enhancement) Implement access control if resumes need to be viewed through an admin interface.
    *   (Future Enhancement) Consider virus scanning for uploaded files.
    *   (Future Enhancement) Use cloud storage (S3, GCS) with signed URLs for more secure access.

## 14. Performance Considerations

### 14.1. Frontend Performance
*   **Vite Build Optimizations:** Vite provides code splitting, minification, and tree shaking by default.
*   **Lazy Loading:** (Future Enhancement) Implement React.lazy for page components or heavy sections to improve initial load time if needed.
*   **Image Optimization:** (Manual Step/Future Enhancement) Optimize images in `public/assets/` for web (compression, correct formats like WebP).
*   **Memoization:** Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback` where appropriate to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components.
*   **Framer Motion:** While powerful, complex animations can impact performance. Monitor and optimize as needed.
*   **Bundle Analysis:** (Future Enhancement) Use tools like `vite-plugin-visualizer` to analyze bundle sizes.

### 14.2. Backend Performance
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Node.js's non-blocking I/O is leveraged.
*   **Database Queries:** Mongoose queries are generally efficient. For complex scenarios:
    *   (Future Enhancement) Add indexes to MongoDB collections on frequently queried fields.
    *   (Future Enhancement) Optimize complex queries.
*   **Caching:** (Future Enhancement) Implement caching strategies (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed, non-dynamic data if performance becomes an issue.

## 15. Known Issues & Limitations (Example)

*   **Chatbot Simplicity:** The TzurBot is rule-based and has limited conversational abilities. It cannot handle highly complex or out-of-scope queries effectively.
*   **No Admin Interface:** Management of bookings, contacts, applications, and newsletter subscribers currently requires direct database access or review of email notifications.
*   **Basic Error Logging:** Server-side error logging is primarily to the console. Production logging to a persistent store/service is recommended.
*   **Limited Accessibility Audit:** Only initial accessibility considerations have been implemented. A full WCAG audit is advised.
*   **File Upload Serving:** Resumes are served statically from the backend's `uploads` folder. This is functional but less secure/scalable than cloud storage for production.
*   **Module System in Backend:** Initial `server/package.json` had `"type": "module"` but code uses CommonJS (`require`). This needs to be consistent (recommend removing `"type": "module"` from `server/package.json` or converting all backend code to ES Modules). This was noted as analyzed but is a critical point for execution.

## 16. Future Enhancements & Roadmap Suggestions

*   **Advanced Chatbot (NLU Integration):** Integrate with Dialogflow, Rasa, or similar for more intelligent conversations.
*   **Admin Dashboard:** Develop a secure admin panel for managing site data.
*   **User Authentication & Client Portal:** Allow clients to log in to view project status, files, or specific information.
*   **Blog/CMS Integration:** Add a blog or integrate a headless CMS for easy content management.
*   **E-commerce Lite:** For selling specific digital products or service packages directly.
*   **Comprehensive Testing Suite:** Implement unit, integration, and E2E tests.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automate testing and deployment.
*   **Enhanced Analytics & Reporting:** Integrate more detailed analytics and provide custom dashboards.
*   **Internationalization (i18n):** If targeting multiple language audiences.
*   **Improved Accessibility:** Conduct full WCAG audit and implement recommendations.
*   **Cloud Storage for Uploads:** Migrate resume uploads to AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, etc.
